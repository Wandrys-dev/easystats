Description: The 'easystats' is meta-package that contains a set
    of packages, all of which aim to provide a unifying and consistent
    framework to tame, discipline and harness the scary R statistics and
    their pesky models. This package is designed to make it easy to
    install and load multiple 'easystats' packages in a single step.
